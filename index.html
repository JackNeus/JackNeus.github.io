<h4> Elevator Pitch </h4>
Trying to make sense of all the events at Princeton and find those you are interested in can be overwhelming. There's no shortage of posters around campus, listserv emails, and facebook events; however, there's no centralized repository of all the events on campus, easily searchable by day or type. Publicizing events on campus can also be a logistical nightmare because of the all the different forms in which students are overloaded events. In creating Princeton Events, we aim to provide an easier way to both publicize and discover events at Princeton.
